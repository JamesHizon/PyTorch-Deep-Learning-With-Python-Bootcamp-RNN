Recurrent Neural Networks projects taught by Jose Portilla

In this section, I had the opportunity to learn about how to predict the future, using time series data plots corresponding to recurrent neural networks. Real-world data would include "Beer and Wine sales" as well as "Energy Production."
Mainly, we study a given data set, train and test the data, and then use the previous behavior to predict what the next month's trends (highs and lows) will be. The more epochs (forward passes), the less error we obtain.
